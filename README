wiitar README
-------------

Use your Wii Guitar Hero 3 Controller as a MIDI instrument.

Good luck building wiitar. It's by no means an easy task!

Dependencies:

   * python2.6-dev (CPython 2.6 + development headers)
   * libasound2-dev (ALSA)
   * autoconf
   * libbluetooth-dev (BlueZ)
   * A MIDI synthesiser. I've been testing with the real-time software
     synthesiser, Timidity++.
   * swig (wrapper interface generator)
   * libwiimote (http://github.com/tcoxon/libwiimote)

Instructions:

   * First, build libwiimote:
      $ autoconf
      $ ./configure
      $ make
   * Next, go into wiitar, and type make. If wiitar and libwiimote are
      in the right places relative to each other (i.e. their base
      directories are adjascent), it should all just work. If not, you'll
      probably need to edit wiitar/pywiimote_src/Makefile.
   * Put libwiimote/lib on your LD_LIBRARY_PATH env variable.
   * We need the address of your wiimote before we can run wiitar. Run
      `hcitool scan', and copy the 12-hex-digit BDADDR next to your wiimote
      (recognisable by "Nintendo RVL-CNT-*").
   * Execute `python wiitar.py <BDADDR>' substituting the BDADDR of your
      wiimote for <BDADDR>
   * Press the HOME button on the wiimote to exit.

Where it is in terms of code:

   * I really have no idea. I last worked on this a couple of years ago and
      I didn't keep any notes.

   * There was some work on a "MIDI Hero" game. I don't remember how far
      that got.
